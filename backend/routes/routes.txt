1. Store files in format "<name>.route.js"
2. Here we store the main routes of the files, like if you are handling the routes for crud functions in one model, we create one route file for that
3. Here is an example:
        const express = require('express')
        const { index_cproject, create_cproject, update_cproject, del_cproject } = require("../controllers/project.controller.js"); // here we import the related controllers file

        const router = express.Router();// use router function in express

        router.get("/", index_cproject); //add route for each crud function
        router.post("/create", create_cproject);
        router.put("/update", update_cproject);
        router.delete("/delete/:id", del_cproject);

        module.exports = router;

4. Then we import these routes in the main file and make path for each crud function:
    const projectRouter = require("./routes/project.route.js"); // first import the route file to index.js
    app.use('/server/project', projectRouter); //this is the path to access the crud functions for the project model

5. So now if we use function get("http://localhost:8010/project/"), then we will get all the stored projects 
6. If we post("http://localhost:8010/project/create") and we include a json with project details, that project will get created in the database.
